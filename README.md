ParseTools
==========

some parsing tools in Python

The entire library is just a single parse.py file.

Right now, calc.py is an example of how to use it -- looks easy and intuitive eh?

Usage
=====

Check out calc.py


Implementation
==============

Top down parser with memoziation.

So use a lot more memory than naive top down parser, but runs linearly with respect to input string.
